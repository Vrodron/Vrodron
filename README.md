Hi, Iâ€™m Veronika,

a data scientist with specific passion in remote sensing and data pipline creation.
One example of a flight planning tool which I developed with @tretterlbach can be found here:
https://github.com/awi-response/garmin_fpl/tree/GTN750_flightplanning

Iâ€™m currently taking a deep dive into deep learning structures for point cloud analysis.
For this I am really happy about the effort of @HuguesTHOMAS in establishing a very well mantained repository for Kernel point convolutions.
I adapted the code for an application of a recently published forest-LiDAR dataset which can be found together with the KPConv-model routines 
in the repository KPConv-Pytorch_FORinstance.
